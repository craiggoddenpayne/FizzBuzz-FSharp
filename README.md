# FizzBuzz Code Kata F Sharp

This is my attempt at the fizzbuzz kata, but this time in F#

The original specification for the kata can he found here 
http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz
  
- This is my first attempt at using F#
  
- I have used functional languages before (Scala) but only through tutorials, and never using TDD.
  
- I'm going to check in after every change so that you can view the smallest unit of change when using red green refactor


A quick summary of the FizzBuzz kata 

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". 



The idea is to identify the smallest unit of work, and write in a TDD style.

### Tech

This kata was written using visual studio 2015 community edition, F# and imports NUnit using nuget.
